/**
 * Applies exponential moving average (EMA) smoothing to pose landmarks.
 * 
 * EMA smoothing reduces jitter in landmark positions by blending the current
 * value with previous values. The formula is:
 * 
 *   smoothed = alpha * current + (1 - alpha) * previous_smoothed
 * 
 * A higher alpha (closer to 1.0) gives more weight to current values (less smoothing).
 * A lower alpha (closer to 0.0) gives more weight to previous values (more smoothing).
 * 
 * Typical values for pose smoothing: 0.3 to 0.5
 * 
 * Usage:
 * ```
 * val smoother = LandmarkSmoother(alpha = 0.4f)
 * val smoothedFrame = smoother.smooth(rawFrame)
 * ```
 * 
 * Thread Safety: This class is NOT thread-safe. Use a single instance per thread.
 * 
 * @param alpha Smoothing factor (0.0 to 1.0). Default is 0.4.
