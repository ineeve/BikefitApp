/**
 * One Euro Filter for temporal smoothing with adaptive cutoff frequency.
 * 
 * Based on Casiez et al. 2012: "1€ Filter: A Simple Speed-based Low-pass Filter
 * for Noisy Input in Interactive Systems"
 * 
 * The One Euro Filter adapts its cutoff frequency based on the signal's speed:
 * - When the signal moves slowly, uses high smoothing (low cutoff frequency)
 * - When the signal moves quickly, reduces smoothing (high cutoff frequency) to maintain responsiveness
 * 
 * This approach reduces jitter during slow movements while maintaining responsiveness
 * during fast movements, making it ideal for pose landmark smoothing.
 * 
 * Formula:
 * - cutoff_frequency = minCutoff + beta * |velocity|
 * - alpha = 1 / (1 + tau / deltaTime) where tau = 1 / (2 * PI * cutoff_frequency)
 * - filtered_value = alpha * raw_value + (1 - alpha) * previous_filtered
 * 
 * @param minCutoff Minimum cutoff frequency (Hz). Lower = more smoothing. Default: 1.0 Hz
 * @param beta Speed coefficient. Controls how much the cutoff frequency increases with velocity. Default: 0.02
 * @param dCutoff Cutoff frequency for velocity computation (Hz). Default: 1.0 Hz
 * 
 * Thread Safety: This class is NOT thread-safe. Use a single instance per thread.
