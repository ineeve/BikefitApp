/**
 * Configuration for hip angle analysis thresholds.
 * 
 * Hip angle is the minimum internal angle at the hip joint during TDC
 * (top dead center of pedal stroke). This represents the most closed
 * position of the hip during the pedal revolution.
 * 
 * A closed hip angle (<45°) can:
 * - Restrict diaphragm movement and breathing
 * - Reduce glute activation and power
 * - Cause discomfort on long rides (soft tissue pressure)
 * 
 * A very open hip (>60°) may indicate:
 * - Position is too upright for intended use
 * - Reduced aerodynamic efficiency
 * - Potential frame size mismatch (too small)
